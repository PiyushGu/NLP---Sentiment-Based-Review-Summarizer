This projects aims at summarizing products reviews into one comprehensive review by capturing important features from a reviews corpus and then predicting their sentiments (positive or negative) based on the semantic similarity between the feature and the sentiment related expression. It saves the customers of an e-commerce website like Amazon, eBay etc. from going over a pile of reviews to identify the pros and cons of a product before making a buying decision. All the existing systems naively classify the reviews as positive or negative. A customer still has to take the burden of going over them and identifying the product features which he/she likes or dislikes. This projects provides with a technique to generate a concise and ever enhancing summary of the products based on the previous customer reviews. Further it also delivers sentiment based categorization of the features which can be helpful to customers in making buying decisions.
